Java lab 7 practicing loops

## PART 1: Practicing While Loops

1. In the **WhileLoops** class, write a method named **eoCount** that contains a while loop that reads in integers from System.in, and counts the even and odd numbers separately.
1. In the **WhileLoops** class, write a method named **mean** that contains a while loop that reads in integers from System.in and calculates the mean of the numbers entered.

## PART 2: Practicing For Loops

1. In the **ForLoops** class, create a method named **forSum** that calculates the sum 1+2+3+...+n where n is given as user input:
    * Example output will look like below:
    
    ```
    Number? 8
    The sum is 36
    ```

1. In the **ForLoops** class, create a method named **rangeSum** that sums a range/interval of numbers, and prints the range. Your program should not care if the smaller or larger numbers are entered first:
    * Example output will look like below:
    
    ```
    Number? 8
    Number? 3
    The sum is: 33
    ```

    * The sum in the above example is the result of: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

1. In the **ForLoops** class, implement a method named **factorial** that calculates the factorial of a number read in from System.in:
    * e.g. 9 Factorial means: 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1;
    * Example output will look like below:

    ```
    Number: 9
    Factorial: 362880
    ```

## PART 3: Loop Refactoring

1. In a class named ReWrites, rewrite the while loops in the sumRewrite method without the break condition and the boolean **true** in the parenthesis.
1. In a class named ReWrites, rewrite the while loops in the avgRewrite method as a for loop instead of a while loop.

## PART 4: Turn In

* Make sure to use the Git tab at the bottom of IntelliJ to create a Feature1 feature branch
* Commit and Push your running code back to your GitHub account
* Issue a Pull request back to my Java-Lab-007 repo
* Cut and Paste the Pull request URL into your Canvas assignment to turn it in.
